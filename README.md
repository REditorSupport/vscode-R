This [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension provides support for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org), including features such as R language service based on code analysis, interacting with R terminals, viewing data, plots, workspace variables, help pages, managing packages, and working with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents.

The R and R Markdown syntaxes are located in a slibing package [vscode-R-syntax](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R-syntax).
